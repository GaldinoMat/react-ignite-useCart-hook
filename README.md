# React Shoppingcart hook

## Objectives

The main objective behind this project was to learn how to use the useContext hook to provide a context to share state and data accross multiple components inside an application.

## Functionalities

Basically the app simulates a sportive shoe store, with a mocked minicart to represent the final checkout. The main challenge of this app was how to properly set the functions inside the shopping cart hook and how to handle the data provided to it. After this the context can be used in alsmot all components, handling the data communication between the shoes' shelf and the checkout.

## What I learned

Besides being considered one of the most basic hooks there is, useContext is quite complicated to grasp at first glance. It differs so much from the usual useState and useEffect hooks, in which can be just declared and used inside their own components, but provide so much versatility when you learn how to properly use it.
